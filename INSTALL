The current replicast build system is almost as simple as it can be - it's just
a Makefile. An autoconf build system is on the TODO list.

Replicast is likely to be very portable, although it currently has only been
compiled and run under Linux. The only non-POSIX routine I'm aware if in it
is getopt_long(), which exists under Mac OS X, so it is likely to complile
out of the box on that.

While developing it I used both gcc and clang with the -Wall flag, so I think
there should be very few errors or warnings if other C compilers are used.
