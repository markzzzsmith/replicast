1. IPv4 Static Routes for Multicast Input and Output Interface Selection

e.g.

	'ip route 224/4 dev eth0'

	'ip route 224.4.4.4/32 dev eth1'
	'ip route 224.5.5.5/32 dev eth2'


N.B. outbound interface must have an IPv4 address


2. IPv6 Static Routes for Multicast Input and Output Interface Selection


e.g.

	'ip -6 route ff05::/16 dev eth0 table local'
	'ip -6 route ff02::5/128 dev eth1 table local'


to view static multicast routes

	'ip -6 route show table local'

	
3. Misc Notes

3.1 IPv6 Multicast in VLC

IPv6 multicast addresses need to have interface name specified, as well as
being enclosed in square brackets e.g.

[ff02::15%eth0]
